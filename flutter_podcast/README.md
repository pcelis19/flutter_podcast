# flutter_podcast

A cross platform podcast platform that primarily uses the iTunes Api to search and retrieve podcast results. 

## Getting Started

### Firebase
 

Ensure that you follow the steps needed for Firebase to work on any Flutter project. 

You will need to inject your own `google-services.json` file that you would get from Firebase console by creating a new project and registering an Android application. Follow the prompts from Firebase from there.
